/**
 * @brief       main.c
 * @details     Every time that AN2 is higher than VDD*4/8, an UP-interrupt is triggered.
 *
 *              This firmware is just an example about how to use the LPCOMP on the nrf51422. The system
 *              will handle everything on the Interruptions ( Low power mode selected ).
 *
 * @return      NA

 * @date        14/July/2017
 * @version     14/July/2017    The ORIGIN
 * @pre         This firmware was tested on the nrf51-DK with EmBitz 1.11 rev 0 ( SDK 1.1.0 ).
 * @warning     Softdevice S310 was used although the file's name is S130. The softdevice
 *              is not used in this example anyway because of Bluetooth was not used.
 * @pre         This code belongs to AqueronteBlog ( http://unbarquero.blogspot.com ).
